                        <h2>How rich are the Windsors?</h2>
                        <p>Very. The bulk of the money that
                            supports the House of Windsor—
                            sometimes called The Firm—flows
                            through the reigning monarch,
                            Queen Elizabeth II. She has three
                            sources of income. First, she receives
                            an annual payout of taxpayer money
                            called the Sovereign Grant, which
                            last year yielded $107 million.
                            Second, she gets the profits from a
                            vast land portfolio called the Duchy
                            of Lancaster, which has been in the
                            royal family since the 13th century
                            and includes several castles, large
                            tracts of rural land in England and
                            Wales, and the Savoy Estate, a
                            patch of prime real estate in central
                            London. Last year the duchy brought
                            in around $28 million. Finally, Her Royal Highness has significant
                            inherited personal wealth and a large investment portfolio of
                            unknown size. The Sunday Times (U.K.) recently estimated her
                            wealth at $482 million. Her son Charles, the Prince of Wales, has
                            his own funding stream from the Duchy of Cornwall, which he
                            inherited at age 3, when his mother became queen. That duchy
                            includes extensive property holdings that yielded $28 million last
                            year, some $6.5 million of which went
                            to his sons, William and Harry.</p>

                        <h2>What is the Sovereign Grant?</h2>
                        <p>Until <time>2012</time> the monarch received
                            a fixed annual payment called the
                            Civil List. It was replaced by the
                            Sovereign Grant, which is a percentage
                            of the profits from the Crown
                            Estate, a massive property portfolio
                            that includes swaths of London’s West
                            End and holdings across the U.K.,
                            as well as half the U.K.’s shoreline.
                            The Sovereign Grant covers palace
                            upkeep, official travel, and the Royals’
                            household staff, which numbers over
                            400. The money doesn’t cover security
                            costs, which are considerable. Whether
                            the Royals represent a good deal for
                            taxpayers is a matter of sharp debate.
                            In the early 1990s pressure built to
                            lower their overhead, which among
                            other things led to an agreement that
                            the Queen and Prince of Wales would
                            pay income tax and sell the royal
                            yacht. But the firm Brand Finance has
                            calculated the Royals’ worth to the
                            U.K.’s economy at $2.3 billion, primarily
                            because they serve as a magnet
                            for tourism; help sell souvenirs, newspapers,
                            and other news products; and
                            provide plotlines for films, books, and
                            TV shows. <q>They’re like a giant PR
                                campaign for the U.K.,</q> said David
                            Haigh, CEO of Brand Finance.</p>

                    <h2>What does ‘the job’ of a Royal entail?</h2>
                    <p> <q>The role of the Queen and her family is to bolster Britain’s
                            'national identity, unity, and pride,'</q> according to the royal website.
                        In practice, that means various members of the royal family
                        take part in some 2,000 engagements each year, including state
                        banquets, luncheons, receptions, ribbon cuttings, and garden parties.
                        (When Prince Philip retired in
                        <time>2017</time>, it was calculated that he’d
                        attended 22,191 events, giving 5,493
                        speeches.) Royals also make visits
                        to service members at home and
                        abroad, serve as patrons for organizations,
                        and assist charities. Some
                        operate their own charities, such as
                        Charles’ Prince’s Trust, which helps
                        disadvantaged young people.</p>

                    <h2>Do the Royals rule the U.K.?</h2>
                    <p>In practice, the Queen exerts no
                        meaningful control over Britain’s
                        constitutional monarchy, but she
                        does hold a symbolic role and a
                        number of specific powers. The
                        Queen’s approval, or Royal Assent,
                        is required for an act of Parliament
                        to become law. (No assent has been
                        denied since <time>1708</time>.) She appoints
                        the prime minister after an election
                        and meets with him or her weekly,
                        offering counsel. She can also summon
                        and suspend Parliament and is
                        officially the military commander in
                        chief, with the sole power to declare
                        war. The Queen can bestow knighthood
                        and other honorary titles, grant
                        pardons, and reduce prison sentences.
                        She last exercised that power in
                        2001, when she ordered the release
                        of two inmates who had rescued a
                        prison worker from an attack by a
                        wild boar.</p>

                    <h2>Are there other holdings?</h2>
                    <p>The Queen personally owns
                        Sandringham House, her country
                        retreat in Norfolk, and Balmoral
                        Castle in Scotland, which was
                        bought by Queen Victoria in <time>1852</time>.
                        She owns (though she can’t sell)
                        the Royal Collection, comprising
                        thousands of paintings, tapestries,
                        photographs, books, metalworks,
                        and other artwork and artifacts, and
                        the Royal Philatelic Collection, one
                        of the world’s largest stamp collections.
                        The Crown also lays claim to
                        all unmarked swans in open waters,
                        a decree dating to a time when swan
                        meat was coveted, and all whales,
                        sturgeon, and porpoises within

            <h2 class="red">Harry and Meghan’s valuable brand</h2>
            <p>
                For Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, stepping
                away from royal duties means giving up taxpayer
                funding, but the couple is not likely to feel it much.
                Public money from the Sovereign Grant, they have
                estimated, has covered only 5 percent of their
                operating costs; the rest comes from Harry’s father,
                Prince Charles, and his Duchy of Cornwall. In the
                royal separation agreement announced last week,
                Charles will continue to fund his son and daughterin-
                law for a year, as they seek to become “financially
                independent.” Harry has considerable inherited
                wealth on his own: His mother, Diana, left him
                an estimated $13 million, and he was bequeathed
                many millions more by his great-grandmother, the
                Queen Mother. Then there’s the estimated $5 million
                Meghan has banked from her television work.
                They’ll now have to pay rent on Frogmore Cottage,
                their U.K. residence, and repay the $3.1 million in
                taxpayer funds spent to renovate the home. But
                the couple has sought a potentially valuable trademark
                on the name “Sussex Royal” and will apparently
                seek to generate their own income—possibly
                through book deals, speaking fees, fashion products,
                and various product endorsements. <q>Harry
                    and Meghan’s break from the royal family may
                    just be the marketing move of <time>2020</time>,</q> said Kevin
                Mercuri of Propheta Communications, a public
                relations firm specializing in branding. <q>The fact
                    that the Sussex Royal brand was born of Harry’s
                    love for his wife and son will not go unnoticed by
                    North American consumers.</q>
